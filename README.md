# Kernel Trainning ðŸ”¥

## Introduction

Here, I am going to work and have fun with Linux kernel. When I was young, I registered at [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/) and did some of its task. It was a great experience for me and because of university I dropped it, and now they aren't accepting new people, so I regret it.

| Transport   |  RawIP  |
| Network     |  Eth0   |
| Link Layer  |         |

#### RawIP

Simple project for testing and using `SOCK_RAW` option of `socket()` system call
in this project I simply create IP packet and fill IP header by myself in application.
Please note that in order to run this application you need root access.
