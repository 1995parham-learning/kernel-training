** kstrtol function:
/*
 * kstrtol - convert a string to a long
 * @s: The start of the string. The string must be null-terminated, and may also
 *  include a single newline before its terminating null. The first character
 *  may also be a plus sign or a minus sign.
 * @base: The number base to use. The maximum supported base is 16. If base is
 *  given as 0, then the base of the string is automatically detected with the
 *  conventional semantics - If it begins with 0x the number will be parsed as a
 *  hexadecimal (case insensitive), if it otherwise begins with 0, it will be
 *  parsed as an octal number. Otherwise it will be parsed as a decimal.
 * @res: Where to write the result of the conversion on success.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -ERANGE on overflow and -EINVAL on parsing error.
 * Used as a replacement for the obsolete simple_strtoull. Return code must
 * be checked.
