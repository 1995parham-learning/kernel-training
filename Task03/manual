Install and Configure git
===========================
I'll leave you to figure out how to install git on your system - one thing you will need to is run this command once you've finished setting it up.

[git config --global format.signoff true]

That will format the patches so they are acceptable to the kernel gods.

Clone The Linux Kernel
===========================
Nice and easy - will take a little bit of time as the kernel is quite large.

[git clone -b staging-next git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git]

Then, of course, cd into the directory.

A New Branch
==========================
We need to create a branch to work on.

[git branch mypatch]

Then, let's switch to the new branch.

[git checkout mypatch]

Make The Edits
==========================
Open up your favourite code editor, and make the changes :-)
Check The Diff

Double check that the changes are what we expect.

[git diff]

Commit The Changes
==========================
[git commit -a]

Create The Patch
==========================
We want to create a patch for master from the spelling branch.

[git format-patch master..mypatch]

That will create a file called something like:

0001-Your-commit-message.patch

Check Your Working
==========================
There are some scripts which will make sure everything is hunk-dory.

[./scripts/checkpatch.pl 0001-Your-commit-message.patch]

Who To Mail?
==========================
The patch has to be emailed to the maintainer of the code. Optionally, it can go to other people as well.

For a "trivial" patch - we can send it to the Linux Kernel Trivial Patch Monkey - trivialà¹‘kernel.org.

[./scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-Your-commit-message.patch]

Out should pop an email address!

Setting Up Email
==========================
If you haven't already, git needs to be able to send email.

Install git-email
==========================
[sudo apt-get install git-email]

This needs adding to ~/.gitconfig

[sendemail]
from = YourName < email@example.com >
smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
smtpuser = email@gmail.com
smtpencryption = tls
smtppass = PASSWORD
chainreplyto = false
smtpserverport = 587

Personally, I set an app specific password in the Gmail Security panel.

Ok, so let's send this puppy!

[git send-email --to whoever@example.org --cc someoneelse@example.com 0001-Your-commit-message.patch]

This will launch an interactive interface where you can double-check everything and, if you're happy, send the email.
That's All Folks

Well, that's all it takes to send in a patch request.
